This script processes a DEM and an NDWI image of the area of interest (AOI) to generate outlines and their corresponding centerlines. At this stage, the produced outlines must be filtered to retain only subglacial bedforms, reducing noise from processes like post-glacial activity, before proceeding to the calculation of morphometric parameters.

The folder includes all the required inputs to run the script, along with the expected outputs.

An additional script is available if you prefer to use a custom grid for statistical sampling.

It is recommended to visualize the results—whether the outlines with their morphometric parameters or the sampled maps—using GIS software like QGIS to facilitate data exploration and analysis.
