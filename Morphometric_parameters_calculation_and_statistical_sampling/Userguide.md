This script uses the outlines of sorted bedforms along with the corresponding centerlines to generate a range of morphometric parameters. These morphometric parameters are then statistically and spatially sampled on a hexagonal grid.
The folder includes all the required inputs to run the script, along with the expected outputs.  

An additional script is available if you prefer to use a custom grid for statistical sampling.  

It is recommended to visualize the results—whether the outlines with their morphometric parameters or the sampled maps—using GIS software like QGIS to facilitate data exploration and analysis.
